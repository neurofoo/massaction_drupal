<h2><p><a name="About">About</a></p></h2>
<p>A. PSD by the multitaper method showing peaks in theta but not beta or gamma ranges. Long time segments (≥6 sec) give PSD with power-law distributions, which reflects the scale-free dynamics of cerebral cortex (Freeman and Breakspear, 2007). The optimal pass band is 5 Hz, as shown by the symbol ‘ – ‘ at the frequency band selected for analysis in the mid-beta range.</p>
<p>B. Log10 analytic power shows a succession of down spikes, the deepest of which are referred to as down spikes. The deepest are null spikes (Freeman, 2009). The latencies from the arbitrary start of the display are in sec</p>
<p>C. The superimposed 62 ECoG filtered signals show maximal spatial coherence in two high-amplitude bursts of oscillation separated by minima referred to as beats in Rayleigh noise. The null spike at the minima in the envelope of the oscillations 21.098 sec is an example of a phase transition. Not all Rayleigh beats manifest phase transitions. The line segment shows the time range of the movies.</p>


<h2><a name="Perspective">Perspective</a></h2>

<p>The movie shows a perspective image of the scalar electric potential field in the mid-beta 20-25 Hz range from 21 sec to 21.6 sec (0.6 sec), with the amplitude color-coded. The task for analysis is to identify the stable components of phase and analytic power (analytic amplitude squared) of multiple bursts of oscillations at differing center frequencies and mean phase. The tendency for rotation prevents use of PCA and ICA, which assume time-invariance of the signals over space, i.e., spatial stationarity.</p>

<h2><a name="NullSpick">Examples are Shown of Null Spikes</a></h2>
<p>This movie shows a perspective representation of the log10 analytic power from 21 sec to 21.6 sec (0.6 sec) across the three clusters of down spikes. The color-coding shows the fluctuating amplitude and phase of the filtered signal (not the analytic amplitude or power). The temporal and spatial localization of the down spikes is apparent.</p>

<h2><a name="ContourPlots">Contour Plots Show the Locations</a></h2>
<p>The same data as in B0F are shown as seen from vertically over the surface and color-coded to represent power: blue is minimum. The spatial localization is limited by the interelectrode distances averaging 0.79 mm in an approximately 6x6 mm array placed on the surface of the rabbit visual cortex.</p>

<h2><a name="PhaseCone">A Phase Cone Appears Shortly after a Null Spike</a></h2>
<p>The phase gradient is radially symmetric about a center point that closely conforms to the location of the preceding null spike. The maximum lead of the analytic phase designates the apex of a cone with downward slope, indicating a phase lag to the periphery called an explosion. The approximate co-location of the null spike and the apex of the following phase cone (either maximal lead = explosion, or maximal lag = implosion) is seen only in frames in which a single burst has one dominant frequency.</p>

<h2><a name="ConicApex">The Conic Apex is near the Location of the Null Spike and a Phase Discontinuity</a></h2>
<p>The same data as in C0F are presented as seen from vertically above the cortical surface, color-coded with maximum +π and minimum –π radians. The features of note are the evidence for phase discontinuity in the temporal vicinity of the null spike near 21.1 sec and the array numbers ordinate 6 and abscissa 5.</p>
